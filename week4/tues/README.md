# Introduction to SOAP

## What is SOAP?

**SOAP** is an **XML**-based protocol for accessing web services over HTTP. It has some specification which could be
used across all applications.

**SOAP** is known as the **Simple Object Access Protocol**, and **SOAP** is a protocol or in other words is a definition
of how web services talk to each other or talk to client applications that invoke them.

**SOAP** was developed as an intermediate language so that applications built on various programming languages could
talk easily to each other and avoid the extreme development effort.

## SOAP Introduction

In today’s world, there is huge number of applications which are built on different programming languages. For example,
there could be a web application designed in Java, another in .Net and another in PHP.

Exchanging data between applications is crucial in today’s networked world. But data exchange between these
heterogeneous applications would be complex. So will be the complexity of the code to accomplish this data exchange.

One of the methods used to combat this complexity is to use XML (Extensible Markup Language) as the intermediate
language for exchanging data between applications.

Every programming language can understand the XML markup language. Hence, XML was used as the underlying medium for data
exchange.

But there are no standard specifications on use of XML across all programming languages for data exchange. That is where
SOAP software comes in.

SOAP was designed to work with XML over HTTP and have some sort of specification which could be used across all
applications.

## Advantages of SOAP

SOAP is the protocol used for data interchange between applications. Below are some of the reasons as to why SOAP is
used.

- When developing SOAP based Web services, you need to have some of language which can be used for web services to talk
  with client applications. SOAP is the perfect medium which was developed in order to achieve this purpose.


- SOAP is a light-weight protocol that is used for data interchange between applications. Note the keyword ‘light.’
  Since SOAP programming is based on the XML language, which itself is a light weight data interchange language.


- SOAP is designed to be platform independent and is also designed to be operating system independent. So the SOAP
  protocol can work any programming language based applications on both Windows and Linux platform.


- SOAP works on the HTTP protocol, which is the default protocol used by all web applications.

## SOAP Building Blocks

The SOAP specification defines something known as a “SOAP message” which is what is sent to the web service and the
client application.

The SOAP message is nothing but a mere XML document which has the below components.

- An Envelope element that identifies the XML document as a SOAP message – This is the containing part of the SOAP
  message and is used to encapsulate all the details in the SOAP message. This is the root element in the SOAP message.


- A Header element that contains header information – The header element can contain information such as authentication
  credentials which can be used by the calling application. It can also contain the definition of complex types which
  could be used in the SOAP message. By default, the SOAP message can contain parameters which could be of simple types
  such as strings and numbers, but can also be a complex object type.

A simple SOAP service example of a complex type is shown below.

Suppose we wanted to send a structured data type which had a combination of a “Tutorial Name” and a “Tutorial
Description,” then we would define the complex type as shown below.

The complex type is defined by the element tag `<xsd:complexType>`. All of the required elements of the structure along
with their respective data types are then defined in the complex type collection.

```
<xsd:complexType>     
 <xsd:sequence>       
 	<xsd:element name="Tutorial Name" type="string"/>         
  	<xsd:element name="Tutorial Description"  type="string"/>
  </xsd:sequence>
</xsd:complexType>
```

A Body element that contains call and response information – This element is what contains the actual data which needs
to be sent between the web service and the calling application. Below is an SOAP web service example of the SOAP body
which actually works on the complex type defined in the header section. Here is the response of the Tutorial Name and
Tutorial Description that is sent to the calling application which calls this web service.

```
<soap:Body>
   <GetTutorialInfo>
		<TutorialName>Web Services</TutorialName> 
		<TutorialDescription>All about web services</TutorialDescription> 
   </GetTutorialInfo>
</soap:Body>
```

## SOAP Message Structure

One thing to note is that SOAP messages are normally auto-generated by the web service when it is called.

Whenever a client application calls a method in the web service, the web service will automatically generate a SOAP
message which will have the necessary details of the data which will be sent from the web service to the client
application.
