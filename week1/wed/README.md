# Introduction to Java

# JDK, JRE, JVM

## Java Development Kit

It's the development kit that you need to create Java program. Basically it's the tools that will take your Java source
code, the code that you write, and convert them into a format that the JRE and the JVM, can execute. So it includes
things like debuggers for testing and for finding errors in your code but also the Java Compiler for compiling that
code.

## Java Runtime Environment

The JRE is used to run your Java program. So basically it includes the libraries, set of different libraries that come
with Java, the various functionality that you can basically execute in your Java code but also Java Launcher. It also
includes the Java Virtual Machine.

## Java Virtual Machine

The Java Virtual Machine is part of the Java Runtime Environment, and it is effectively an abstract computing machine.
The JVM converts bytecode to machine code.

# First Java Program - Hello World!

`public static void main(String[] args)` is the most important Java method. When you start learning java programming,
this is the first method you encounter. Java main method is the entry point of any java program.

## Public

This is the access modifier of the main method. It has to be public so that java runtime can execute this method. So it
means that the main method has to be public. Letâ€™s see what happens if we define the main method as non-public.

## Static

When a member is declared static, it can be accessed before any objects of its class are created.
