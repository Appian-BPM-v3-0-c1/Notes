## Java Development Kit

It's the development kit that you need to create Java programmes. Basically it's the tools that will take your Java
source code, the code that you write, and convert them into a format that the JRE and the JVM, can execute. So it
includes things like debuggers for testing and for finding errors in your code but also the Java Compiler for compiling
that code.
