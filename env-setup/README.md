# Required Technologies

The following technologies are required in order to complete this phase of the program:

- **Intellij**: We will be using Intellij Community as our integrated development environment (IDE). Though you don't
  need an IDE to write code, an IDE provides several features that make rapid development (e.g. quickly writing and
  refactoring code) easier.

- **Git**: We'll be using Git as a version control tool during the course of this program. Not only will you use Git to
  track changes to your projects, but you'll also use it to collaborate with your trainer and with your fellow
  associates.

- **Java SE Development Kit 8**: We will be utilizing Java 8 as our primary language for the duration of the program.
  This software development kit will provide the compiler and runtime environment needed to quickly and efficiently
  develop Java applications.

- **Apache Maven**: Maven is a software project management and build automation tool. We will use it to manage our
  projects' builds as it provides dependency management and streamlines several aspects of the testing life cycle.

- **PostgreSQL 10**: PostgreSQL is an open source relational database. We will leverage this technology in order to
  persist and organize data.

- **DBeaver**: DBeaver is a free, open source universal database tool that is compatible with several external data
  sources, PostgreSQL included. We'll use DBeaver in order to modify our databases and persist data using a simple user
  interface provided to us by the tool.

- **Apache Tomcat 8**: During this program, we will explore web development. As a result, we'll need a runtime
  environment for our web applications. Apache Tomcat provides a web server environment in which we can run our Java
  code so that we can easily and quickly deploy our web applications.

- **Postman**: Postman is used for testing RESTful APIs. We'll use it to set up collections of tests for the RESTful
  APIs we design throughout the program. It can also be used to quickly test a single endpoint.
